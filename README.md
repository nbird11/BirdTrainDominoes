# Bird Train Dominoes
This Bird house-rules version is based on the classic tabletop game Mexican Train, refactored into a text-based python game!

You can read up on the official rules [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/mexican-train/game-rules.php), but 
Bird house-rule differences are explained later in this readme.

This game will include AI that pick the best moves based on the dominoes in their hand.
